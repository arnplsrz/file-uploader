  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `openedAt` on the `File` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `path` on the `File` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `url` to the `File` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `folderId` on table `File` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
